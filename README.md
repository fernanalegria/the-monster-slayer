The Monster Slayer - First steps with Vue.js 2.x

"The Monster Slayer" is a game where you aim for beating the monster by choosing the right strategy. Will you be able to defeat it?

Web app based on Vue.js 2.x. I built it as part of the course "Vue JS 2 - The Complete Guide (incl. Vue Router & Vuex)" to practise with Vue instances, conditionals and rendering lists. Here is a link to the course in case you want to dive deeper into it: https://www.udemy.com/vuejs-2-the-complete-guide/
